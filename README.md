# Multithreading-application
The repository consist multithreading application of each technology
The repository has seprate folder according to the technology where i implemented
the multithreading applications.

Multithreading :- 
  
  Multithreading leads to the multitasking feature our Operating System also 
  multitasking in nature.
  To running the threads concurrently are known as multithreading,
  suppose we having one operation in that operation have several task
  then the operation are the main thread and the several tasks running under that
  operation are the threads
  
  Threads also consider as light-weight process,but thread creation are less expensive as
  compare to Process creation.
  
  for that purpose we follows multithreading over the multiprocessing.
  
  Because creation of process are highly expensive, and inforamation sharing betweeen the 
  process are  restricted, each process needs seprate address spacce on ram to survive.
  
  multiple threads resides under the main process which also known as main thread, multiple threads
  under one thread can share the information, creation of thread are less expesive,all the threads 
  can survive in the address space of main thread/process.
