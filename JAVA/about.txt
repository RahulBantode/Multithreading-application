The repository consist of mutithreading and thread synchronization
application using JAVA-

Java is the first who introduce the multithreading concept at language level.

In java we can multithreading is achieve by two ways-
1. By extending the Thread class
2. By implementing the runnable interface

1. When we creating the thread using / extending the  Thread class
   we can faciliate with all the function of the thread class
   
2. When we implements the runnable interface - which having only one method
   declaration as void run() which is the abastract method we can override it and 
   implement it by own logic.
   
3. Thread Synchronization :-
   When the resource are global for all the threads and 2 or more thread requested for the resource at
   a same time, then due to lack of synchronization the ambiguity is arise so to resolve this ambiguity or problem
   we need make thread synchronize.
   
   To make thread synchronization -
   the resource or method which are global for all the thread make it as synchronized method
